A collection of a few simple Physically Based Animation Projects
Created by: Fahim Hasan Khan

List of Projects
================
1) A program that animates a roller-coaster with different camera views (First person, third person). 
2) A series of physically-based simulation models of elastic/flexible objects using the mass-spring approach. 
  a) mass on a spring,
  b) chain pendulum (as series of masses connected by springs),
  c) cube of jelly,
  d) hanging cloth.
3) An implementation of Reynoldsâ€™s model of schools, flocks, and herds. 
It creates simulations/animations illustrating basic flocking behavior as well as well as more advanced behaviors 
(avoidance of / reaction to collisions, split of flocks around obstacles, merge of flocks).
